//! Retry requests
//!
//! A `Client` has the ability to retry requests, by sending additional copies
//! to the server if a response is considered retryable.
//!
//! The [`Policy`] makes it easier to configure what requests to retry, along
//! with including best practices by default, such as a retry budget.
//!
//! # Defaults
//!
//! The default retry behavior of a `Client` is to only retry requests where an
//! error or low-level protocol NACK is encountered that is known to be safe to
//! retry. Note however that providing a specific retry policy will override
//! the default, and you will need to explicitly include that behavior.
//!
//! All policies default to including a retry budget that permits 20% extra
//! requests to be sent.
//!
//! # Scoped
//!
//! A client's retry policy is scoped. That means that the policy doesn't
//! apply to all requests, but only those within a user-defined scope.
//!
//! Since all policies include a budget by default, it doesn't make sense to
//! apply it on _all_ requests. Rather, the retry history applied by a budget
//! should likely only be applied to the same host.
//!
//! # Classifiers
//!
//! A retry policy needs to be configured with a classifier that determines
//! if a request should be retried. Knowledge of the destination server's
//! behavior is required to make a safe classifier. **Requests should not be
//! retried** if the server cannot safely handle the same request twice, or if
//! it causes side effects.
//!
//! Some common properties to check include if the request method is
//! idempotent, or if the response status code indicates a transient error.
