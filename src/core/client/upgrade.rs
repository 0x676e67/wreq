//! HTTP Upgrades
//!
//! This module deals with managing [HTTP Upgrades][mdn] in crate::core:. Since
//! several concepts in HTTP allow for first talking HTTP, and then converting
//! to a different protocol, this module conflates them into a single API.
//! Those include:
//!
//! - HTTP/1.1 Upgrades
//! - HTTP `CONNECT`
//!
//! You are responsible for any other pre-requisites to establish an upgrade,
//! such as sending the appropriate headers, methods, and status codes. You can
//! then use [`on`][] to grab a `Future` which will resolve to the upgraded
//! connection object, or an error if the upgrade fails.
//!
//! [mdn]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism
//!
//! Sending an HTTP upgrade from the [`client`](super::client) involves setting
//! either the appropriate method, if wanting to `CONNECT`, or headers such as
//! `Upgrade` and `Connection`, on the `http::Request`. Once receiving the
//! `http::Response` back, you must check for the specific information that the
//! upgrade is agreed upon by the server (such as a `101` status code), and then
//! get the `Future` from the `Response`.
