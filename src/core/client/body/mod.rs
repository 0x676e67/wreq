//! Streaming bodies for Requests and Responses
//!
//! For both [Clients](crate::client), requests and
//! responses use streaming bodies, instead of complete buffering. This
//! allows applications to not use memory they don't need, and allows exerting
//! back-pressure on connections by only reading when asked.
//!
//! There are two pieces to this in crate::core::
//!
//! - **The [\`Body`\] trait** describes all possible bodies. crate::core: allows any body type that
//!   implements `Body`, allowing applications to have fine-grained control over their streaming.
//! - **The [`Incoming`] concrete type**, which is an implementation of `Body`, and returned by
//!   crate::core: as a "receive stream" (so, for server requests and client responses).
//!
//! There are additional implementations available in [`http-body-util`][],
//! such as a `Full` or `Empty` body.
//!
