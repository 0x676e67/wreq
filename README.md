An ergonomic all-in-one HTTP client for browser emulation with TLS, JA3/JA4, and HTTP/2 fingerprints.

## Features

- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- Cookie Store
- Header Order
- Redirect Policy
- Rotating Proxies
- Certificate Store
- WebSocket Upgrade
- HTTPS via BoringSSL
- HTTP/2 over TLS Emulation

## Example

This asynchronous example utilizes [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) with optional features enabled, requiring the following configuration in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
wreq = "5"
wreq-util = "2"
```

And then the code:

```rust,no_run
use wreq::Client;
use rquest_util::Emulation;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), wreq::Error> {
    // Build a client
    let client = Client::builder()
        .emulation(Emulation::Firefox136)
        .build()?;

    // Use the API you're already familiar with
    let resp = client.get("https://tls.peet.ws/api/all").send().await?;
    println!("{}", resp.text().await?);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Emulation

- **HTTP/2 over TLS**

  **JA3**/**JA4**/**Akamai** fingerprints cannot accurately simulate browser fingerprints due to the sophistication of TLS encryption and the popularity of HTTP/2. wreq does not plan to support parsing these fingerprint strings for simulation. Users are encouraged to customize the configuration according to their own needs.

- **Emulation Device**

  Most browser device models share the same TLS and HTTP/2 configuration, differing only in the User-Agent. The browser device emulation template is managed by [wreq-util](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq-util).

## Building

Avoid compiling with packages that depend on `openssl-sys`, as it shares the same prefix symbol with `boring-sys`, potentially leading to [link failures](https://github.com/cloudflare/boring/issues/197) and other issues. Even if compilation succeeds, using both `openssl-sys` and `boring-sys` together can result in memory segmentation faults. Until the upstream Boring resolves these linking conflicts, using `rustls` is the best workaround.

Install the dependencies required to build [BoringSSL](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-prerequisites)

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake perl pkg-config libclang-dev musl-tools -y

cargo build --release
```

This GitHub Actions [workflow](.github/compilation-guide/build.yml) can be used to compile the project on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.
