An ergonomic and modular Rust HTTP Client for high-fidelity protocol matching, featuring customizable TLS, JA3/JA4, and HTTP/2 signature capabilities.

## Features

- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- HTTP Trailer
- Cookie Store
- Redirect Policy
- Original Header
- Rotating Proxies
- Tower Middleware
- WebSocket Upgrade
- HTTPS via BoringSSL
- HTTP/2 over TLS Parity
- Certificate Store (CAs & mTLS)

## Example

The following example uses the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) runtime with optional features enabled by adding this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
wreq = "6.0.0-rc"
wreq-util = "3.0.0-rc"
```

And then the code:

```rust
use wreq::Client;
use wreq_util::Emulation;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> wreq::Result<()> {
    // Build a client
    let client = Client::builder()
        .emulation(Emulation::Safari26)
        .build()?;

    // Use the API you're already familiar with
    let resp = client.get("https://tls.peet.ws/api/all").send().await?;
    println!("{}", resp.text().await?);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Behavior

- **HTTP/1 over TLS**

In the Rust ecosystem, most HTTP clients rely on the [http](https://github.com/hyperium/http) library, which performs well but does not preserve header case. This causes some **WAFs** to reject **HTTP/1** requests with lowercase headers (see [discussion](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/discussions/2227)). **wreq** addresses this by fully supporting **HTTP/1** header case sensitivity.

- **HTTP/2 over TLS**

Due to the complexity of **TLS** encryption and the widespread adoption of **HTTP/2**, browser fingerprints such as **JA3**, **JA4**, and **Akamai** cannot be reliably emulated using simple fingerprint strings. Instead of parsing and emulating these string-based fingerprints, **wreq** provides fine-grained control over **TLS** and **HTTP/2** extensions and settings for precise browser behavior emulation.

- **Device Emulation**

**TLS** and **HTTP/2** fingerprints are often identical across various browser models because these underlying protocols evolve slower than browser release cycles. **100+ browser device emulation profiles** are maintained in [wreq-util](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq-util).

## Building

Compiling alongside **openssl-sys** can cause symbol conflicts with **boringssl** that lead to [link failures](https://github.com/cloudflare/boring/issues/197), and on **Linux** and **Android** this can be avoided by enabling the **`prefix-symbols`** feature.

Install [BoringSSL build dependencies](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-prerequisites) and build with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake perl pkg-config libclang-dev musl-tools git -y
cargo build --release
```

This GitHub Actions [workflow](.github/compilation-guide/build.yml) can be used to compile the project on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.

TLS fingerprinting alone isn't enough for modern bot protection. **[Hyper Solutions](https://hypersolutions.co?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wreq)** provides the missing piece - API endpoints that generate valid antibot tokens for:

**Akamai** • **DataDome** • **Kasada** • **Incapsula**

No browser automation. Just simple API calls that return the exact cookies and headers these systems require.
